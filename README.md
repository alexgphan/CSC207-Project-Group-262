## Problem Domain: HR System

** Uses a calendar system to schedule availabilities of TA's and Instructors for scheduled Lectures and Labs. Allows employees to request for leave which will notify other employees to fill in the time slot. Pay system would probably be hourly to each individual and depending on their role they might have better salaries. For lecture time slots there could be openings for multiple TA's and one Professor.
